Install prerequisites
    Make sure you have installed:
    Node.js (v16 or later is fine)
    npm (comes with Node.js)
    MongoDB (running locally on mongodb://localhost:27017)

setup project
    npm install

Start MongoDB
    If you have MongoDB installed locally, start it with:
    mongod

Run the server
    Since your main file is index.js, start the app with:
    node index.js

    or, if you want auto-reload on file changes:
    npx nodemon index.js

Access the app
    Open your browser and go to:
    ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:5000
